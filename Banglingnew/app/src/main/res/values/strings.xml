    <string name="lorem_ipsum">
        My name is Bangling Yin, you can call me  Bonnie, and I am a graduate student at Pace
        University. My undergraduate degree is in Marketing, and I had no prior experience with
        coding before. Last semester, I took an "Introduction to Java" course, which served as my
        first exposure to programming. Although I am still not very proficient, I am eager to learn
        more.

        I am particularly interested in mobile application development. However, I am aware that I
        lack background knowledge and experience in this area, which may pose challenges.
        Nonetheless, I believe in my ability to overcome these obstacles with perseverance.

        I hope to receive support from both my instructors and classmates throughout this semester.
        I am committed to putting in the effort and dedication required to learn and grow in this
        field.

        Thank you for the opportunity, and I look forward to collaborating with you all.
